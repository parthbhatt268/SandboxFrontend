Q1) What is meaning of ^ in the version mention in package.json file

Ans -> The version specified after the caret (^) is the "fixed" version. In your example, it's 11.10.6.
The caret allows npm to update to the latest version for the specified major version (11.x.x) 
while respecting backward compatibility.
So, with "^11.10.6," npm would install versions like 11.10.7, 11.11.0, or any other version 
with 11 as the major version, as long as it doesn't include breaking changes.

In semantic versioning (SemVer), a version number is represented as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. 
The caret (^) allows for updates in the MINOR and PATCH versions but prevents updates to a 
new MAJOR version that might introduce breaking changes.

Q2)     "format": "prettier --ignore-path .gitignore --write \"**/*.{js,jsx,css,scss}\"" 
What does this line mean?
so basically we have to keep common format for every developer so we install prettier and use comomon version for formatting
step 1 - install prettier npm add --dev --exact prettier --force
step 2 - go to package json and check if nstall and add one line in scripts section
    "format": "prettier --ignore-path .gitignore --write \"**/*.{js,jsx,css,scss}\"" 
This script will format all JS/JSX files, CSS/SCSS files using Prettier</s> and ignore gitignore file...
step 3 - Run command in terminal
    > npm run format
